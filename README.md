**BJJ Rules Assistant - Avoid penalties, compete confidently**

An AI-powered assistant that provides instant answers about IBJJF and ADCC rules using advanced retrieval techniques and medical safety integration.

## Problem

BJJ athletes get penalized because it's overwhelming to go through full rulebooks, but they need quick answers about techniques used in daily sparring.

## Solution

Ask questions like "Are heel hooks legal for brown belts in IBJJF?" and get clear answers with rule citations and medical safety context.

## Performance Results

Advanced RAG system with 60.1% improvement in answer accuracy over baseline:

| Metric            | Score | Status        |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Faithfulness      | 0.730 | ðŸŸ¢ Good       |
| Answer Relevancy  | 0.676 | ðŸŸ  Acceptable |
| Context Precision | 0.912 | ðŸŸ¢ Excellent  |
| Context Recall    | 0.756 | ðŸŸ¢ Good       |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY and COHERE_API_KEY to .env

# Validate installation
python validate.py

# Run application
python run.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501` - PDF processing happens automatically on first run.
